# 11. Own This! A Portfolio of Platform Cooperativism, in Progress

by Trebor Scholz

Today, the power asymmetry between those who own the World Wide Web’s
core platforms and the users who depend on them, is more pronounced than
ever. A decentralized digital economy is needed that is built on
broad-based ownership and democratic governance. Platform Cooperativism
could be an answer.

Platform capitalism, the economic system currently dominating the
Internet, is not working for most people. Despite its initial promise as
a new commons, the Internet now serves primarily the few, not the many.

First, the model has resulted in a broken social contract be-tween
workers and businesses, exacerbating income inequality. Platforms like
Airbnb and Uber focus on short-term returns and rapid growth to please
investors, externalizing the risk of business to workers, while offering
few essential benefits. Contract work and automation are replacing
direct employment at every turn. Precariousness abounds. Second,
platform capitalism exacerbates existing social inequities given that
many gigs are performed by people who are invisible to customers.
Persons of color, especially women of color, are seeing less pay, fewer
benefits, and hardly any opportunity for meaningful on-the-job skills
training. Many non-white and disabled platform users remain unprotected
against discrimination, too. And third, we now live in an era of
surveillance capitalism. Despite the fortunes of Silicon Valley
investors and developers, the users who give actual value to platforms
through their data do not co-govern them. The narrative that these
platforms have ushered in a new era of “sharing” only obfuscates the
real revolution: the monetization and capitalization of nearly every
dimension of our lives, from dating to dishwashing. Despite their
continued expansion, investor-backed capitalist platforms dominating
today’s Internet are not invincible. We have seen online empires
collapse before: remember Yahoo, Lotus, Friend-ster, AOL, or MySpace?
There is nothing inevitable about technological development.

In the face of widespread dissatisfaction with capitalism, and in the
face of alarming income inequality driven increasingly by these
capitalist platforms, it is time to collectively ask: ‘What kind of new
digital economy do we want to create?’

## A Humane Alternative to the Winner-Takes-All Economy

Instead of optimizing the online economy for growth and short-term
profits for the few, we need to optimize the online economy for workers
and all people. Platform Cooperativism, as developed by Trebor
Scholz and popularized by countless people around the world,
chiefly Nathan Schneider, does this by applying the 200-year history of
cooperatives – its lessons, principles, and best practices – to the
digital economy.^1,2^

A cooperative is defined as an autonomous association of persons united
voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs
and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled
enterprise. A platform is an online application or website used by
individuals or groups to connect to one another or to organize services.
Platform Co-operativism, the growing movement to cooperatize online
businesses, builds on these values by establishing four key principles
of its own:^3,4,5^

-   Broad-based ownership, in which stakeholders and workers own, and
    therefore direct and control, the technological fea-tures,
    production processes, algorithms, data, job structures and all other
    aspects of their online platform.

-   Democratic governance, in which all stakeholders and work-ers who
    own the platform collectively self-govern the entity through a
    one-person, one-vote principle.

-   Co-design of the platform, in which various users and marginalized
    persons are included in the design and creation of the platform so
    that software is not pushed down onto users, but instead grows out
    of their needs, capacities, and aspirations.

-   And, a commitment to open source development, so that platform
    co-ops can build new structures of collective ownership and
    democratic governance, while lifting up other emerging cooperatives
    in disparate locations, who can avoid having to reinvent the wheel,
    and apply the cooperative model through a commons of open source
    code.

Whichever way you look at them, platform co-ops place people at the
center, and allow worker-owners to set their own objectives for
business. Through distributed ownership, platform co-ops ground the
digital economy democratically through a fundamentally new business
model that, for the first time, puts workers and users ahead of profits
and stockholders. This is not only a struggle for social justice. It is
also a struggle for economic development. There have been also
successful attempts of platform co-ops pushing back against the gig
economy.^6,7^

## Platform Co-ops Are Already Here

The platform co-op movement is not a figment of the academic
imagination. The platform co-op movement is already here. It has gained
momentum in numerous sectors and in numerous countries around the globe.
The ecosystem of platform co-ops, some 240 projects currently, reaches
from Brazil to Switzerland, India to Canada, East Asia to Africa, and
places in between.^8,9,10^ Various types of platform co-ops are
developing and pushing into new markets against the status quo:

-   Producer platform co-ops like Stocksy, and Resonate

-   Worker platform co-ops like Green Taxi, Co-Rise, and Up & Go

-   Data platform co-ops like MIDATA, and Social.coop

-   And mutual risk co-ops like smart are proving the sustaina-bility
    and resiliency of the new business model.

Platform co-ops are ripe for interventions into additional industries,
such as food delivery, trash pickup, elder care, short-term rental,
transportation, data entry, child care, home repair, social media,
higher education, and many others. Projects like Fairbnb, CoopCycle, and
others are pushing into these sectors.

Workers value platform cooperatives too, because they offer several key
benefits not available in the traditional “business-as-usual” approach
of platform capitalism:

-   Better job quality and security

-   An inclusive design that respects workers needs

-   Workers’ formal inclusion in governance of the enterprise

-   Value creation not just for workers, but for the community

Platform co-ops also exhibit greater productivity among workers,
demonstrate greater resiliency in unsteady markets, and encourage
workers to organize not just in the workplace, but in their communities
and around larger political issues. Online tools like Loomio are
emerging to help facilitate democratic governance for these businesses,
accompanying the best practices emerging from existing platform co-ops.
Finally, employee ownership, is a central component of cooperatives.
Worker ownership is supported by both conservative and liberal political
parties across continents.^11^

Platform co-ops offer a new vision for society. They are actually
existing alternatives to some of our current economic dilemmas. The
platform co-op movement offers a critical reform, but one that is also
deeply structural. It is a reform that has the potential to
fundamentally alter power relations in an enduring fashion. If one
economic paradigm can slowly lose power through this reform, so too can
its alternative gain power, building on small successes. This is the
potential of the platform co-op movement.
