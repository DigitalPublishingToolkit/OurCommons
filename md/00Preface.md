# Preface

Our world is darkening and major shifts are coming. Our social and
economic systems are strained and we have reached the limits of what the
planet can endure. We are yearning for change, but what does that look
like and where do we go from there?

We believe real change happens when we challenge the status quo and
embrace the future. The commons help us do both. In this book, we have
tried to showcase how powerful that combination can be.

This book would not have been possible without the support of the
Fondation Charles Léopold Mayer pour le Progrès de l’Homme. We also
could not have done any of this without the work of our partners,
teachers and friends in the international commons movement.

Thomas and Sophie, Amsterdam, April 2019.
