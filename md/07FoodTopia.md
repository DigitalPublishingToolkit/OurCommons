# 6. Social Circularity: Food-sharing Platforms Are Re-inventing Urban Solidarity

by Thomas de Groot

Foodtopia started three years ago in Murcia, a university town in the
southeast of Spain. Initially just a pop-up kitchen on the university
campus, it was run by a collective of four passionate people from
various backgrounds, from engineering to retail. “We were, and still
are, worried about the future that we leave to our grandchildren”, says
Jesús, one of the founders. “That is why we wanted to start a revolution
in the perverse food industry”.

And revolution is still needed, they claim. “The planet is warming at an
alarming rate and as a global community we are simply not doing enough.
People are already dying from climate collapse all over the world. The
chaos will increase. Meanwhile, ignoring warnings from everywhere, we
keep talking about economic growth. Our political representatives have
abandoned us, or so it seems.”

The idea behind Foodtopia was to ask people to bring their leftover
food to this campus kitchen, in order to turn it into communal meals for
all.^1^ The response was overwhelming right from the start. Within a few
weeks, the Foodtopia crew were feeding hundreds of people per day. Now,
they have food hubs in many other towns and villages, that run complete
circular systems, from local agriculture to production to communal
meals.

“We are learning a lot from the urban farming revolution that happened
in Cuba in the 1990s”, Jesús explains. After the Soviet Union collapsed,
Cuba lost their main trading partner. That, combined with stifling
economic sanctions from the US, they had no choice but to radically
change their agriculture and economy in order to stop the ensuing
famine. Cubans turned to urban farming on a massive scale, pioneering
techniques that people still use today, all over the world.

Food is more than just a means of sustenance, the people behind the
Foodtopia project claim. It is the basis for community building, for
civic life. Gathering food, or growing it, cooking together and
organizing meals, it is all part of creating healthy and inclusive
communities. And community members can only do their part to stop
climate change if they work together. Jesús explains that Foodtopia
strives for resilience in local food systems and that they all have a
strong sense of urgency. “We have all seen the studies: our planet will
collapse if we continue on this path of carbon dependence. Degrowth is
the only real solution.”

The Spaniards are not alone in their conviction. In cities all over the
world, organizations are creating new social practices by building
communities around food. Some work exclusively with food waste, others
don’t. Some never charge any money for the meals and others expect one
or two euros in return. But all share the belief that food stands for
something much more: it is a symbol for civic sovereignty and social
revival. “People need to feel sovereign in their neighbourhood”, says
Jesús. “Food turns out to be the perfect starting point for
strengthening the community by sharing resources.”

BuurtBuik is a Dutch non-profit that fights against foodwaste by
collecting surplus food from supermarkets, catering companies and
restaurants in order to cook free meals with that food for everyone in
the neighbourhood. It is also a movement to promote inclusive
sustainability or, as they call it, ‘social circularity’. BuurtBuik
works with companies like HelloFresh, social organisations like the
Salvation Army and institutions like the municipality of Amsterdam to
raise awareness about foodwaste, social exclusion, poverty, loneliness
and health.^2^

The Netherlands is one of the richest countries on earth, yet many Dutch
people have lived mostly the adverse effects of thirty years of
exceedingly neoliberal and austere policies. Decades of center-left and
center-right governments have led to a paradoxal situation. Dutch GDP
grows 1 or 2 percent each year, yet around 200,000 Dutch children and
8 percent of households live below the poverty line.^3,4^ In cities like
Amsterdam, 1 in 6 people live below the poverty line, 27,000 of which
are children.^5^ 7 per cent of the population (more than one million
people) feel severely lonely.^6^ In Amsterdam, that group accounts for
one-sixth of the population.^7^ Lonely people have a statistically
higher chance of being poor and vice versa.^8^ Both poverty and
loneliness are very bad for your health. In fact, lonely people that
live in poverty have a health-life expectancy (the number of ‘healthy
years’) that is 15 years lower than the average young urban professional
that might live in the same street as them.^9^

All over The Netherlands, teams of volunteers organize BuurtBuik-meals
in community centers. The meals are cooked using only surplus food from
supermarkets and restaurants in the neighbourhood. All meals are always
free and accessible for everyone. This is the formula that has made
BuurtBuik grow out to become one of the most vital and inspiring
initiatives in the country. The volunteers at BuurtBuik have set out to
battle food waste, which is a huge problem. In Amsterdam, for instance,
businesses and consumers together throw away more than 100,000 kilograms
of good food each year.^10^ If food waste were a country, it would be in
the top three biggest polluters in the world, right behind China and the
United States.^11^ The emissions that are released to sustain our global
food production accounts for one tenth of all human-made greenhouse gas
emissions.^12^

Just working on one of these challenges, whether it is poverty or food
waste, would be a daunting task for any organisation. But groups like
BuurtBuik in The Netherlands or FoodTopia in Spain explicitly choose a
systemic approach. This means that they see all of these challenges as
part of one problematic system. So they feel it is only natural that
they tackle all of these problems at once. “Less state, more
neighbourhood”, says Jesús. “We look for shared identities of our
neighbours, we strive for social, political and economic ownership of
people, of citizens. Our food system should be the empowering catalyst
for communities of people to become once again the drivers of their own
future.”

BuurtBuik and FoodTopia make us change the way we look at the system.
*Food as a system* is a financial crisis, a health care crisis, a
natural crisis and a social crisis, they seem to say. The planet will
not survive if we don't change the way we produce, distribute and
consume food. “Our goals are to eliminate emissions and plastics from
the food sector”, Jesús says. But there is more. “We also want to
democratize food, make it more healthy, reduce water usage, increase the
resillience of cities, eliminate social exclusion, hunger and political
tension and serve as an inspiration to others.”

This seems ambitious, he agrees. “But the problem is all-encompassing
and so we need equally broad solutions. Food as a whole is responsible
for a large part of global energy consumption, emission of greenhouse
gases, plastic pollution, deforestation, fresh water usage and waste
production. For the planet, food as a system is a real problem. And the
need for food in general is the cause of most conflicts and social
tensions. The affect of food on our health is massive, a large part of
our health problems are caused by food.”

BuurtBuik anticipates a real shift in the way people think about ‘green’
issues. “For us to really counter climate change, we must do it
together”, says Suzanne, one of the coordinators of the organisation’s
Utrecht-branch. “That is why our meals are always free. We turn
everyone, from the guests that eat with us to the entrepreneurs who
donate food, into allies in the fight for a living planet.” The Dutch
organisation also tries to push this mentality shift. “We try to get
people to be a part of our fight against food waste. This can be as
simple as eating one of our meals. By talking about food waste we try to
get people to think about what they consume and what they waste. What do
they throw away and why?”

By starting small, you can make a big impact”, says Suzanne. BuurtBuik
works hyper-locally, in various neighbourhoods. All over cities like
Amsterdam, Utrecht and Eindhoven, there are local BuurtBuik-teams. The
young people that run these teams try to change the people’s attitude
towards food. They work with foods and vegetables that are not so pretty
anymore, but still very much edible. However, “you cannot taste what the
food used to look like”, says Suzanne. “In the end, it’s the taste that
matters.”

Foodtopia works local too. It is what makes it work. Jesús says: “We
build and design factories in the heart of big cities. The innovative
design makes them adapt to local urban production.” From there, they
distribute the food to smaller neighbourhoods and villages. This system
of hubs is geared towards increased resilience. It allows for different
menus, depending on local traditions. “It also keeps our carbon
footprint low”, Jesús explains. “We process our own basic materials like
grains, vegetables and oils. We work with re-usable containers that
people use over and over and we don’t waste food so there is very little
waste.”

BuurtBuik follows a similar strategy, Suzanne says. “We use cargo
bicycles to move the food around, so we don’t produce any additional
emmissions. By using food that would otherwise have been thrown out, we
avoid water and emmission loss and make sure those investments in food
will not go to waste. We aim to cook healthy. So not only do we save
food, we also make a healthy 3-course meal out of it that teaches our
guests what healthy food can be. By working locally we are in close
contact with our guests. Any overflow of food can be taken home, in
containers they have brought from home. This was we try to not only keep
food waste down, but waste in general.”

In recent years, the people driving the organisation, mostly students
and refugees, have really started to make an impact on the popular
discourse in the country. Policymakers and private actors now aknowledge
the value of inclusive sustainability. In 2019, the municipal government
of Amsterdam is creating a new food strategy that emphasizes the need
for this social component to the food system. And all over The
Netherlands, start-up entrepreneurs are launching businesses that focus
on community wealth.

The philosophy and practice of Foodtopia and BuurtBuik represent the
transformation, democratisation and politicisation of culinary culture.
These are necessary steps toward an urgent ecological and social
transition out of the impending social and ecological collapse. Or as
Jesús puts it: “The cultural importance of food is critical to
understand the ongoing ecological and social crisis. The globalization
of the agro-industrial system has a harmful impact on the health of
societies and ecosystems. Unfortunately, most of western food culture
ignores the destructive consequences of agro-industrial practices.
Cultural practices and stories focused on food neglect the intrinsic
relationship between hegemonic food culture and the dominant economic
and energy regime. We are still an exception, in that we are
transforming food culture within neighborhoods by leading the way
towards a counter -hegemonic culinary culture that is economically
viable, socially desirable, and ecologically sustainable.”
