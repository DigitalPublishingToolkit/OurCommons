# 9. Could This Local Experiment Be The Start Of A National Transformation?

by George Monbiot

One London borough has been bringing people together to work, socialise
and dream. The results are extraordinary.

If there is hope, it lies here, in the most deprived borough in London.
Barking and Dagenham has shocking levels of unemployment, homelessness,
teenage pregnancy, domestic violence and early death. Until 2010, it was
the [main
stronghold](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4974870.stm) of
the British National party.^1^ Its population turns over at astonishing
speed: every year, about 8% of residents move out. But over the past
year it has started to become known for something else: as a global
leader in taking back control.

Since the second world war, councils and national governments have
sought to change people’s lives from the top down. Their efforts, during
the first 30 years of this period at least, were highly effective,
creating public services, public housing and a social safety net that
radically improved people’s lives.

But they had the unintended consequence of reducing our sense of agency,
our social skills and mutual aid. Now, in the age of austerity, state
support has been withdrawn, leaving many people with the worst of both
worlds: neither the top-down protection of government nor the bottom-up
resilience of the community it replaced. I believe we still need strong
state support and well-financed public services. But this is not enough.
The best antidote to the rising tide of demagoguery and reaction is a
[politics of
belonging](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/09/george-monbiot-how-de-we-get-out-of-this-mess)
based on strong and confident local communities.^2^

Those who study community life talk about two kinds of social network:
[bonding and
bridging](https://www.socialcapitalresearch.com/difference-bonding-bridging-social-capital/).^3^
Bonding networks are those created within homogeneous groups. While they
can overcome social isolation, they can also foster suspicion and
prejudice, while limiting opportunities for change. Bridging networks
bring people from different groups together. Research suggests that they
can [reduce

and
[unemployment](http://www.academia.edu/11729767/_Civic_Health_and_Unemployment_II_The_Case_Builds_)
and, by enhancing community voices, improve the [quality of
government](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719037.2010.532962).^4,5,6^

After [routing the BNP](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8668885.stm),
which had taken [12 of 51
seats](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/may/05/localelections2006.uk)
in 2006, Labour councillors in Barking and Dagenham saw that it wasn’t
enough to target people’s needs and deliver isolated services.^7,8^ They
wanted to move from paternalism to participation. But how?

Just as the council began looking for ideas, the [Participatory City
Foundation](http://www.participatorycity.org/) led by the inspiring
Tessy Britton, approached it with a plan for an entirely different
system, developed after [nine years of
research](https://issuu.com/participatorycity/docs/designed_to_scale_v.1)
into how bridging networks form.^9,10^ Nothing like it had been attempted by a
borough before. The council realised it was taking a risk. But it
[helped to fund](https://www.lbbd.gov.uk/every-one-every-day) a £7m,
five-year experiment, called [Every One, Every
Day](https://www.weareeveryone.org/).^11,12^

Researching successful community projects across the world, the
foundation discovered [a set of
common](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xobncy0wVby19kjT7Ii0giGsAtvg8rt3/view)
principles.^13^ Typically, they demand little time or commitment from local
people, and no financial cost. They are close to people’s homes, open to
everyone, and designed to attract talent rather than to meet particular
needs. They set up physical and visible infrastructure. And rather than
emphasising novelty – the downfall of many well-intentioned schemes –
they foster simple projects that immediately improve people’s lives. The
foundation realised that a large part of the budget would need to be
devoted to evaluation, to allow the plan to adapt almost instantly to
residents’ enthusiasm.

They launched Every One, Every Day in November 2017, [opening two
shops](https://www.weareeveryone.org/visit-us/) (the first of five) on
high streets in Barking and Dagenham. The shops don’t sell anything but
are places where people meet, discuss ideas and launch projects. The
scheme has also started opening “maker spaces”, equipped with laser
cutters and other tools, sewing machines and working kitchens. These
kinds of spaces are usually occupied by middle-class men but, so far,
90% of the participants here are women. The reason for the difference is
simple: almost immediately, some of the residents drew a line on the
floor, turning part of the space into an informal creche, where women
take turns looking after the children. In doing so, they overcame one of
the biggest barriers to new businesses and projects: affordable
childcare.

I visited the old printers’ warehouse in Thames Road, Barking, that the
scheme is turning into a gigantic new workshop where people can start
collaborative businesses in areas as diverse as food, clothing and
renewable energy. Already, the experiment has catalysed a remarkable
number of projects set up spontaneously by residents.

There are welcoming committees for new arrivals to the street, community
potluck meals, cooking sessions and street lunches. There’s a programme
to turn boring patches of grass into community gardens, play corners and
outdoor learning centres. There’s a bee school and a chicken school
(teaching urban animal husbandry), sewing and knitting sessions, places
for freelance workers to meet and collaborate, computing and coding
workshops, storytelling for children, singing sessions and a games cafe.
A local football coach has started training people in the streets.
There’s a film studio and a DIY film festival too, tuition for
spoken-word poets and a scheme for shutting streets to traffic so
children can play after school. Local people have leapt on the
opportunities the new system has created.

Talking to residents involved in these projects, I kept hearing the same
theme: “I hated this place and wanted to move out. But now I want to
stay”. A woman in Barking told me that “getting out and socialising is
very hard when you’re unemployed”, but the local shop has “massively
improved my social life”. Now her grandad and mum, who were also
isolated, come in as well. Another explained that, before the community
shop opened in Dagenham, all her friends were in other boroughs and she
felt afraid of local people, especially “the young hoodies”. Now she has
local friends with origins all over the world: “I no longer feel
intimidated by the young guys round here, because I know them … It’s
been the best year of my adult life.” Another, a black woman who had
lived in fear of the BNP’s resurgence, told me: “This is hope at last.
Hope for my generation. Hope for my grandchildren.”

There’s a long way to go. Four thousand of the borough’s 200,000 people
have participated so far. But the rate of growth suggests it is likely
to be transformative. The council told me the programme had the
potential to reduce demand for social services as people’s mental and
physical health improves. Partly as a result, other boroughs and other
cities are taking an interest in this remarkable experiment. Perhaps
it’s not the whole answer to our many troubles. But it looks to me like
a bright light in a darkening world.
