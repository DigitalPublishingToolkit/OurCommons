# 14. The Medicines Patent Pool: A Remedy for the Anti-Commons

by Ellen‘t Hoen

In 2002, at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona, a group of
people met in a small meeting room to discuss the high prices of
antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.

In those days, generic, non-patented ARVs were much lower priced and
available from companies in India, as they were not barred from
producing these medicines because India did not grant product patents
for medicines. But this was going to change. The World Trade
Organization's rules demanded that India be compliant with the global
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights — the
TRIPS Agreement. As a result, India would have to grant medicines
patents from 2015 on. At the same time, newer and more robust medicines
had started to become available in wealthier nations at high prices.
Concerns were growing about how these new treatments could be made
available in easy-to-use three-in-one pills in the absence of generic
production.

To the surprise of the audience in Barcelona, Knowledge Ecology
International's Director James Love put up a picture of the patent
application for an early 20th century airplane^1^. The early developers
of the airplane held patents on the technology. They were not keen to
share their technology and took legal action whenever they suspected
infringement of their patents. But these patent wars were really
starting to hamper the United States' ability to develop and produce
military airplanes. The government had to intervene and so established
the first government mandated patent pool in which all airplane
producers were required to collaborate^2^.

"If we can do this for reasons of war, why can't we do this to fight
HIV/AIDS?" This was the question James Love put to the group at the AIDS
conference. He outlined how the intellectual property needed for the
production of low-cost AIDS/HIV medicines could be brought together in a
patent pool for any eligible generic producer to use. This would not
only guarantee the production of low cost medicines but also take away
barriers to putting different compounds together in one pill and develop
adapted formulations, such as those needed to treat children.

In such a pooling scheme, a generic producer would be allowed to make
use of the patent in exchange for a royalty payment to the patent
holder. This meant that patents would no longer pose a barrier to the
production and supply of generic medicines, just like it was before the
TRIPS Agreement. Just as the flying machine pool made large-scale
production of military airplanes possible, so would a mandated medicines
patent pool enable large-scale generic production of life-saving
medicines. It was a brilliant idea. The question was how to implement
it.

## The stars align

In 2006, a new global health financing mechanism, called UNITAID, had
been established by a group of countries. Its mission was manifold: to
scale up access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria,
achieve price reductions for medicines that meet international quality
standards and diagnostics, and accelerate availability of medicines.
What set UNITAID apart from other donors at that time was its clear
mandate to work on intellectual property issues related to access to
medicines.

UNITAID's constitution specifically demanded the organisation to support
the World Trade Organization Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public
Health. The Doha Declaration was adopted in 2001 and stated that the
TRIPS Agreement does not stand in the way of measures needed to protect
public health, thereby introducing the primacy of health over trade
considerations. The Declaration further outlined measures countries can
take when patents form a barrier to ensure access to medicines for all,
and suspended the obligation of least developed countries to provide or
enforce medicines product patents^3^. Further, UNITAID was open to new
and innovative ideas to tackle medicine access problems and showed
leadership in taking on promising, yet controversial proposals.

Also, in 2006, the World Health Organization Commission on Intellectual
Property Rights, Innovation and Public health (CIPIH) recommended the
establishment of a patent pool^4^. These developments strengthened the
resolve of Knowledge Ecology International and Médecins sans Frontières
in proposing to UNITAID to establish a medicines patent pool.

The principle of a patent pool is to facilitate the availability of new
technologies by making patents and other forms of intellectual property
more readily available to entities other than the patent holder. The
pool is intended to avert a "tragedy of the anti-commons" in which
people are unable to make use of knowledge because of the entanglement
of property rights that block them^5^.

Patent pools have been established in various fields related to public
health — examples include the Golden Rice in agriculture, a vaccine for
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), as well as multiple areas of
information technology. The aim of all of those initiatives was to
overcome barriers to access and innovation that may arise when relevant
patents are owned by many different entities^6-7^.

The UNITAID Patent Pool, as it was called in the early days, was a new
idea. It focused on medicines and the collective management of
pharmaceutical patents and other intellectual property for the purpose
of accelerating access to medical innovations in low- and middle-income
countries. The purpose of the UNITAID initiative was first and foremost
to serve the public interest by creating the collective management of
intellectual property related to important life-saving medicines. In
essence, it transferred control over intellectual property from
corporations to the larger community, making sure that all people had
access to proper treatment.

After a feasibility study^8^ that concluded that the proposal was indeed
desirable and doable, UNITAID formed an in-house team to develop an
implementation plan for the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) in 2009. A year
later, in 2010, the Medicines Patent Pool was established as a separate
legal entity and opened its doors in Geneva. UNITAID would remain its
core funder until this day.

In the early days, not all players in the global health arena were keen
on the Medicines Patent Pool. Opposition came from unexpected corners
such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was a member of the
UNITAID board. They initially refused to support the establishment of
the Medicines Patent Pool. The Gates' fortune mainly derived from
Microsoft’s intellectual property, which is possibly why the Foundation
was reluctant to support the idea.

The WHO leadership was also reluctant to embrace the initiative for fear
it would fail. They insisted it be set up as a separate legal entity and
not be housed at the WHO to avoid any potential liability issues.
Certain factions of civil society saw the pool as not going far enough.
Some claimed it would undermine other efforts to reform the system of
intellectual property. Others expressed concern that the licenses from
the pool might cover people in the poorest countries, but if they didn’t
cover people in all middle-income countries, those patients would be out
of options^9^.

The key to the pool's success would be the willingness of patent
holders, mostly pharmaceutical corporations, to engage and license their
intellectual property. This was no small order considering that
medicines patents are the crown jewels of the industry. It would not be
easy to persuade them to part with them. Some in the industry responded
to the establishment of the patent pool idea with resistance. For
example, one company told the Financial Times^10^ that they could better
accelerate access themselves and that ‘’The pool’s key focus has been
political in getting access to IP without explaining how it will work.
\[...\] The €4.7m they will spend could save thousands of lives \[by
buying drugs.\]"

Other companies were more forthcoming in the early days. Gilead was
notable in that it publicly declared at the 2008 AIDS conference to be
open to licensing its intellectual property to the Medicines Patent
Pool.

A first breakthrough for the Pool came when the US National Institutes
for Health (NIH) approached UNITAID and offered to license its patents
related to HIV medications. In 2010, the Medicines Patent Pool signed
its first agreement with NIH^11^. It became apparent that this move had
support from the highest political levels when the White House’s
blog^12^ encouraged companies to follow suit and congratulated those^13^
that^14^ did^15^. Gilead, an important holder of patents on essential
and new medicines for the treatment of HIV, followed soon after. The
company signed^16^ its first license agreement with the Medicines Patent
Pool in 2011. That same year, the first generic companies joined the
initiative^17^, which was crucial because generic companies are the ones
that actually produce and sell low-priced medicines.

## Core features of the Medicines Patent Pool

The Medicines Patent Pool is "public health driven", not driven by the
commercial needs of the companies with which it works. It focuses on
essential products and areas of greatest health need. Its country scope
is low- and middle-income countries, which means that it seeks to
include as many countries as possible in the scope of the licenses. The
country scope is one of the great challenges for the Medicines Patent
Pool because pharmaceutical companies do not like to give up large
emerging markets such as Brazil, China, and Russia to their competitors.

Contrary to the airplane patent pool, which was a non-voluntary
mechanism mandated by the government, the MPP was set up as a voluntary
mechanism. This means that its success depended on the willingness of
companies to part with full control over their intellectual property. A
key feature of the Pool is that the licenses allow for multiple
non-exclusive sub-licenses. This enables competition between generic
manufactures which helps to drive down the price. The licenses also
facilitate further innovation by allowing the development of new
"three-in-one pills" or fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) and other
products to treat children.

Another important feature of the MPP is that its work has to be
consistent with the WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health.
This means that the Pool cannot enter into agreements containing terms
and conditions that limit the policy space countries have under
international law, such as using compulsory licensing of medicines
patents. As a result, the Medicines Patent Pool licenses allow the
generic companies to supply generic medicines to countries that are not
listed in the agreement when such countries make use of TRIPS
flexibilities such as compulsory licensing^18^. If the Pool’s licenses
would not allow the generic companies they work with to supply to
countries that have issued a compulsory license, the Pool could
potentially paralyse the effectiveness of such measures.

The Pool's license agreements also include waivers for data exclusivity
and require quality assurances of the medicines. When needed, the
agreements can also provide for technology transfer. A significant and
unique feature is the transparency of the MPP's licenses. They all are
available, in full text, on the MPP’s website^19^.

## State of play today

Today, the Medicines Patent Pool has licenses from nine companies
related to 18 products. All of the standard first- and second- line
treatments for HIV/AIDS, as recommended by the WHO, are covered by
licenses in the MPP. The MPP includes licenses needed to produce a
medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C and also one for tuberculosis.

A total of 24 generic companies and drug developers have licensed from
the Patent Pool. As a result, there are over 130 drug development
projects that are ongoing. The Pool licenses for HIV/AIDS drugs cover
between 92 and 131 countries. This means that between 87% and 91% of
adults with HIV/AIDS, and 100% of children, can benefit from the MPP.

The new first-line HIV treatment, TLD
(tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir), was first developed by licensees of
the MPP^20^. The generic company, Mylan, was the first to obtain
marketing approval for the product in 2017, bringing a truly innovative
product to market as a generic from the first day of sale.

The MPP also has three hepatitis C related licenses. The product
licenses’ territory ranges from 95 to 112 countries representing 47.5%
to 65.4 % of people with hepatitis C. From 2012 to 2017, the Pool has
created US \$553 million in savings. In 2018, the board of the MPP
expanded its mandate to all patented essential medicines.

## Conclusion

The Patent Pool’s achievements are significant for an initiative that,
only nine years ago, was regarded by many in the global health and trade
arena as high risk and likely to fail. Of course, an element of
self-interest of donor countries contributed to its success. Those
countries wanted to make sure that finite global health financing for
medicines was not spent on high-priced branded medicines which would
have severely restricted the number of people that could be treated with
the same amount of money.

It is therefore uncertain whether there will be enough political support
for a similar voluntary licensing schemes for non-communicable diseases
like cancer, diabetes, and asthma. Currently, national governments pay
most of the costs of treatment for such diseases. It is therefore
important that those governments become more vocal on the need for MPP
licenses for medicines for non-communicable diseases. It is encouraging
that some companies have []{#__DdeLink__2690_1356940871
.anchor}signalled to be willing to work with the Patent Pool on cancer
medication^21^.

The Pool has successfully pried some of the hold over medicines
intellectual property, mostly related to HIV and hepatitis C products,
away from the industry and put it to work for the public interest.
However, the work of the Patent Pool did not stretch out to all
middle-income countries, and is so far limited to a set of communicable
diseases. Today’s global struggle to lower prices for other medicines
shows that it is vital that governments retain the right and ability to
make corrections in the management of intellectual property of
companies. This is especially true when such management leads to
undesirable societal effects and does not serve the public interest.
